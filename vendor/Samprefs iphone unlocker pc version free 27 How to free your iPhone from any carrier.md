In this article, we will show you how to use SAMPrefs to unlock your iPhone for free. This method works for iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C and 5S models. However, it is not guaranteed to work for all devices and carriers, so use it at your own risk.
 
## What is SAMPrefs?
 
SAMPrefs stands for Subscriber Artificial Module Preferences. It is a tool that can spoof your iPhone's IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number and trick iTunes into activating your device with any SIM card. This way, you can bypass the carrier lock and use your iPhone with any network.
 
SAMPrefs was originally developed by a Chinese hacker named Loktar\_Sun in 2012. It was later updated by Sam Bingner, the developer of SAM (Subscriber Artificial Module), a similar tool that was discontinued in 2011. SAMPrefs is available as a free app on Cydia, the app store for jailbroken devices.

## How to Unlock Your iPhone with SAMPrefs
 
Before you start, you need to have a jailbroken iPhone with Cydia installed. You also need to have the original SIM card that came with your device or a SIM card from the same carrier. If you don't have these, you might not be able to activate your device after unlocking it.
 
Here are the steps to unlock your iPhone with SAMPrefs:
 
1. Launch Cydia and add the following source: http://repo.bingner.com/
2. Search for SAMPrefs and install it on your device.
3. After SAMPrefs is installed, an icon in yellow will be visible on the springboard saying SAMPrefs. Launch it.
4. Go to Utilities and tap on De-Activate iPhone. This will remove the activation status of your device.
5. After that, insert the desired SIM card on the factory unlocked iPhone.
6. Go back to SAMPrefs and tap on Method. Select By Country and Carrier.
7. Select your country and carrier from the list. If you don't see your carrier, select More Information and copy the IMSI number.
8. Go back to SAMPrefs and tap on Spoof Real SIM to SAM.
9. Go to More Information and paste the IMSI number in the SAM Details section.
10. Tap on Spoof IMSI and then tap on Revert Lockdown to Stock.
11. Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes. iTunes should recognize your device and activate it with the new SIM card.
12. Congratulations! You have successfully unlocked your iPhone with SAMPrefs.

## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you encounter any problems while unlocking your iPhone with SAMPrefs, here are some tips that might help:

- If iTunes gives you an error message or does not activate your device, try restarting your iPhone and iTunes and repeat the process.
- If you see a message saying "Invalid SIM" or "No Service" on your device, try toggling Airplane Mode on and off or rebooting your device.
- If you still don't get any signal, try changing the SIM ID in SAMPrefs to another one from the same carrier or a different one.
- If none of these work, you might need to restore your device to its original firmware and try another unlocking method.

## Conclusion
 
SAMPrefs is a free tool that can help you unlock your factory unlocked iPhone without iTunes or a jailbreak. However, it is not a permanent solution and it might not work for all devices and carriers. If you want a more reliable and hassle-free way to unlock your iPhone, you might want to consider using an official IMEI unlocking service instead.
